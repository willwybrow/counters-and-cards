# Counters and Cards

Counters and Cards, or, C&C, is a replacement for a character sheet feature within a D20 system. It was created with the following intentions:
- Make encounters less predictable by mixing up the actions available to a character
- Express character progression in a more tangible way by adding new cards to a deck instead of just incrementing numbers
- Stave off analysis paralysis on higher-level characters by restricting the available choices at any given moment  

## Setup

### Table Setup
Each player has a *hand* of cards that they literally hold.

Each player has a conceptual play space directly in front of them, called the *table*.

On the table is a zone for cards that are having an active effect on the game. We call such cards *in-play* cards. Each player has 7 slots for placing new cards into play from their hand. Some cards are played *equipped* or *attached* to other cards. These attached cards count as being in play for the purposes of determining active effects and available actions, but no not count towards the 7 slot limit.

Also on the table is the *deck* containing the remainder of the player's available cards. This is placed face down and off to the side. The player will draw from the deck to place cards into their hand.

Finally, each player has a *discard pile* of face up cards that are not in play. Cards that have been expended, either because they are Class or Spell cards that are used once, or because they have a finite number of Uses per day, or because they've been discarded through some other effect, should be placed face-up into this discard pile.

### Hand Setup

At the start of your in-game *day*, shuffle all your cards into your deck and draw 7.

If you do not draw any **Action** cards, shuffle all 7 cards back into the deck and draw 7 again.

### Hand Resetting

Between encounters, your character may, if it is safe to do so, take a *short rest*. Shuffle your current hand and any in-play Spell cards whose durations elapse during the rest, into your deck, then draw 7 cards.

Between days, your character may take a *long rest*. Shuffle every card, including the discard pile, into your deck, then draw 7 cards.

## Gameplay

### Actions
**Actions** may be performed by your character during a combat round. Each action has an action cost that determines how long the action takes to perform (and therefore how many actions can be taken in a round):
- Standard
- Move
- Full-round
- Swift
- Immediate
- Free

Cards that grant actions will have the action type in gold shown underneath the card's name.

### Cards

Cards have a number of different types:

#### Action Cards (Silver)

**Attack** cards represent a repeatable action that your character may do over and over again. Once in-play, Attack cards usually remain unless discarded by some other event. They frequently may be enhanced with **Weapon** cards.

**Action** cards represent actions that your character may take while in combat, but are not necessarily targeted attacks.

#### Spell Cards (Blue)
**Spell** cards represent a single instance of a magical capability your character possesses. Play a card from your hand to cast that spell. Like Actions, each Spell has an Action Cost, and a Spell can only be played if the player has sufficient Actions to cast it. 

**Orison** and **Cantrip** cards are variations of Spell cards that are returned to your hand after casting.

A spell's cast time is its action type. Therefore a spell with a casting time of Full-round cannot be cast in the same turn as a Move action is taken.


A Spell has a Duration, as noted in the top-right corner of the card. If a Spell's duration is Instantaneous, it is cast immediately and does not have any lingering effects. If a Spell's Duration is Concentration, the Spell may last for as long as its caster is able and willing to Concentrate on it. If a Spell's Duration is Rounds, it lasts a number of combat rounds (detailed in the card's description). 

If the Spell has a Rounds-based Duration, add a counter to the card at the beginning of each turn. 

A Spell ends when one of the following conditions are met:
- Immediately, if the Spell's Duration is Instantaneous
- After the specified number of Rounds has elapsed if its Duration is Rounds
- If the caster ceases to Concentrate on the spell, if its Duration is Concentration
- Whenever the caster chooses to dismiss the spell

Once a spell has ended, the spell card is discarded.

#### Defence Cards (Green)
**Defence** cards represent your character's capability to absorb or avoid damage in combat. You may either play one Defence card from your hand or discard one in-play Defence card per turn. You may have as many Defence cards in play as you like, though you may only have one Defence card of each Type in play at any one time. Defence cards' effects are cumulative unless a specific card indicates otherwise.  

#### Weapon Cards (Purple)
**Weapon** cards represent an item in your character's possession that enhances one of their actions. Weapon cards are generally played attached to Attack or Spell cards, modifying the card's properties. If the card to which a Weapon card is attached is discarded, return the Weapon to your hand unless otherwise specified.

#### Consumable Cards (Orange)
**Consumable** cards represent a one or more consumables in your character's possession that may be used as spell components, thrown weapons, or ammunition for an appropriate weapon. Consumable cards may be played attached to Weapon cards that specify an ammunition type, thereby enabling the weapon's attack. If the card to which a Consumable card is attached is discarded, also discard the Consumable.

#### Ability Cards (Peach)
**Ability** cards represent some supernatural power or combat feat known by your character. Once in-play, Ability cards may modify or grant some additional Actions your character can take. If an Ability card has a Uses section and grants an Action, each time that Action is taken, place one counter on the Ability card. Once the number of Uses has been reached, discard the Ability card.

#### Class Cards (Red)
**Class** cards represent your character's unique class or racial meta-abilities. These cards are played straight from your hand and usually modify the state of the table rather than have direct effects on the in-game situation. Their stated effects happen immediately, and do not enter an in-play state. Once played, these cards are discarded.

### Card States
A card is considered *active* if it is both in-play and not otherwise disabled. 

A card may have a number of basic counters placed on it to indicate how many uses or charges have been consumed or how much of its duration has elapsed.

A card can have a special disabled marker placed on it. This could indicate any number of in-game reasons why a card cannot be used at a given moment.

## Playing

At the start of any encounter, all participants draw an additional card from their decks. If any participant is caught by surprise at the beginning of the encounter, they do not draw a card.

Each participant may then roll 1d20 initiative to determine the order in which play will proceed. The character with the highest roll (plus any relevant modifier from in-play cards) will go first. Ties may be broken by additional rolls.

On each participant's turn, they may draw a single card from their deck.

A player may, before taking an action: 
- use a single-use card from their hand (e.g. Class cards)
- put a card in-play from their hand (e.g. Attack cards, Spell cards, Ability cards)
- declare a single use of an in-play Ability
- discard an in-play card

Finally, a player can take an action. Generally they may make a standard action and a move action in any order, two move actions, or make a full-round action. 

A player may also make a single swift action, and unlimited free actions.

Immediate actions, if a player has any in-play, may be taken at any time, even when it is another player's turn.

Some possible move actions a player may take:
- attaching or equipping a Weapon or Defence card from their hand to an appropriate in-play card
- moving their character up to their full movement speed

Some standard actions a player may take:
- cast a Spell with a cast time of Standard
- make an Attack with an action type of Standard
