# Counters and Cards

## Rules

### Table Setup

Each player has a conceptual play space directly in front of them which we will call the *table*.

Cards placed face-up on the table are considered to be *in-play* and their effects are active.

Some cards may or must be attached to other cards. These cards are also considered to be in-play.

Cards that have been expended, usually because they have a finite number of uses or uses per day, should be placed face-down into a single *discard pile*.

### Hand Setup

At the start of your RPG *day*, shuffle all your cards into your deck and draw 7.

If you do not draw any **Action** cards, shuffle all 7 cards back into the deck and draw 7 again.

## Playing

At the start of any combat or social encounter, all participants draw an additional card from their decks. If any participant is caught by surprise at the beginning of the encounter, they do not draw a card.

Each participant may then roll 1d20 initiative to determine the order in which play will proceed. The character with the highest roll (plus any relevant modifier from in-play cards) will go first. Ties may be broken by additional rolls.

On each participant's turn, they may draw a single card from their deck.

In a normal round, a player can either make a standard action and a move action, two move actions, or make a full-round action. A player may also make a single swift action, and unlimited free actions.

Action cards are silver-coloured and determine what actions a player can take. Actions have one of six types:

- Standard
- Move
- Full-round
- Swift
- Immediate
- Free
