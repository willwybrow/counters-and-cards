# Counters and Cards

## Setup

### Table Setup

Each player has a conceptual play space directly in front of them which we will call the *table*.

Each player has a *hand* of cards that they literally hold.

Cards placed face-up on the table are considered to be *in-play*. A player may have a maximum of 7 cards in-play.

A card may be *played*, meaning to place it from a player's hand into one of the player's 7 slots on the table.

Some cards may or must be *equipped* or *attached* to other cards. These cards are also considered to be in-play, but do not count towards the limit of in-play cards.

Cards that have been expended, either because they are Class or Spell cards that are used once, or because they have a finite number of uses per day, should be placed face-down into a single *discard pile*.

### Hand Setup

At the start of your RPG *day*, shuffle all your cards into your deck and draw 7.

If you do not draw any **Action** cards, shuffle all 7 cards back into the deck and draw 7 again.

## Gameplay

### Actions
**Actions** may be performed by your character during a combat round. Each action has an action type that determines how long the action takes to perform (and therefore how many actions can be taken in a round):
- Standard
- Move
- Full-round
- Swift
- Immediate
- Free

Cards that grant actions will have the action type in gold shown underneath the card's name.

### Cards

Cards have a number of different types:

#### Attack Cards (Silver)

**Attack** cards represent a repeatable action that your character may do over and over again. Once in-play, Attack cards usually remain unless discarded by some other event. They frequently may be enhanced with **Weapon** cards.

#### Spell Cards (Blue)
**Spell** cards represent a single instance of a magical capability your character possesses. Spell cards must be in-play to be cast. Once a spell is cast, the spell card is discarded.

**Orison** and **Cantrip** cards are variations of Spell cards that do not need to be discarded after casting.

A spell's cast time is its action type. Therefore a spell with a casting time of Full-round cannot be cast in the same turn as a Move action is taken.

A spell may have a Duration. If it does, turn the spell card sideways to indicate it has been cast. If a spell's duration is a number of rounds, at the start of each subsequent turn, add a single counter to the spell card. When the number of counters equals or exceeds the duration in rounds, discard the spell card.

A spell may also have a special Duration of Concentration. Once cast, turn the card sideways. On each subsequent turn, as a Standard Action, you may choose to continue to concentrate on a currently-active spell. This leaves the spell active. If another Action is taken, or if your character is unable to take an Action this turn for any reason, the spell ceases. Discard the spell card.

#### Defence Cards (Green)
**Defence** cards represent your character's capability to absorb or avoid damage in combat. 

#### Weapon Cards (Purple)
**Weapon** cards represent an item in your character's possession that enhances one of their actions. Weapon cards are generally played attached to Attack or Spell cards, modifying the card's properties. If the card to which a Weapon card is attached is discarded, return the Weapon to your hand unless otherwise specified.

#### Consumable Cards (Orange)
**Consumable** cards represent a one or more consumables in your character's possession that may be used as thrown weapons or ammunition for an appropriate weapon. Consumable cards may be played attached to Weapon cards that specify an ammunition type, thereby enabling the weapon's attack. If the card to which a Consumable card is attached is discarded, also discard the Consumable.

#### Ability Cards (Peach)
**Ability** cards represent some supernatural power or combat feat known by your character. Once in-play, Ability cards may modify or grant some additional Actions your character can take. Ability cards may have finite permitted uses and, once expended, must be discarded.

#### Class Cards (Red)
**Class** cards represent your character's unique class or racial meta-abilities. These cards are played straight from your hand and usually modify the state of the table rather than have direct effects on the in-game situation. Their stated effects happen immediately, and do not enter an in-play state. Once played, these cards are discarded.

### Card States
A card is considered *active* if it is both in-play and not otherwise disabled. 

A card can be turned on its side to indicate its effects are in-progress. 

A card may have a number of basic counters placed on it to indicate how many uses or charges have been consumed or how much of its duration has elapsed.

A card can have a special disabled marker placed on it. This could indicate any number of in-game reasons why a card cannot be used at a given moment.

## Playing

At the start of any encounter, all participants draw an additional card from their decks. If any participant is caught by surprise at the beginning of the encounter, they do not draw a card.

Each participant may then roll 1d20 initiative to determine the order in which play will proceed. The character with the highest roll (plus any relevant modifier from in-play cards) will go first. Ties may be broken by additional rolls.

On each participant's turn, they may draw a single card from their deck.

A player may, before taking an action: 
- use a single-use card from their hand (e.g. Class cards)
- put a card in-play from their hand (e.g. Attack cards, Spell cards, Ability cards)
- declare a single use of an in-play Ability
- discard an in-play card

Finally, a player can take an action. Generally they may make a standard action and a move action in any order, two move actions, or make a full-round action. 

A player may also make a single swift action, and unlimited free actions.

Immediate actions, if a player has any in-play, may be taken at any time, even when it is another player's turn.

Some possible move actions a player may take:
- attaching or equipping a Weapon or Defence card from their hand to an appropriate in-play card
- moving their character up to their full movement speed

Some standard actions a player may take:
- cast a Spell with a cast time of Standard
- make an Attack with an action type of Standard
